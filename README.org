* Introduction
=persp-harpoon= provides a way to quickly mark, jump to, and manage frequently used buffers/files within any Emacs "perspective" (e.g., different projects).
Inspired by the [[https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon][Harpoon plugin for Neovim]], this package allows you to maintain a different buffer list for each perspective, enabling rapid switching and memory of important buffers.

Functionally this is very similar to the amazing [[https://github.com/otavioschwanck/harpoon.el][harpoon.el]]. I needed to be able to manage harpoons by perspectives and not projects. I started writing this as a learning exercise which ballooned into it's own thing. The major difference between =harpoon.el= and =persp-harpoon= is that =persp-harpoon= allows configuring how to separate groups of buffers or harpoons (by configuring =persp-harpoon-current-persp-name-function= and =persp-harpoon-current-persp-buffers-list-function= or using =persp-harpoon-configure=). It was originally written with [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective]] in mind, hence the name.

* Installation / Setup

=persp-harpoon= can be installed from MELPA, straight.el, quelpa, or directly from source.

Example using ~use-package~ and ~straight~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package persp-harpoon
    ;; If using straight
    :straight (persp-harpoon :type git :host github :repo "ahmed-shariff/persp-harpoon")
    ;; If using quelpa
    :quelpa (persp-harpoon :fetcher github :repo "ahmed-shariff/persp-harpoon")
    :bind (("C-c h <return>" . persp-harpoon-add-buffer)
           ("C-c h r"        . persp-harpoon-remove-buffer)
           ;; Displays a buffer which can be used to re-order the harpoons
           ("C-c h m"        . persp-harpoon-show-list)
           ("C-c h c"        . persp-harpoon-clear-buffers)
           ("C-c h o"        . persp-harpoon-switch-other)
           ("C-c h k"        . persp-harpoon-kill-non-harpoon-buffers)
           ("C-c h 1"        . persp-harpoon-jump-to-1)
           ("C-c h 2"        . persp-harpoon-jump-to-2)
           ("C-c h 3"        . persp-harpoon-jump-to-3)
           ("C-c h 4"        . persp-harpoon-jump-to-4)
           ("C-c h 5"        . persp-harpoon-jump-to-5)
           ("C-c h 6"        . persp-harpoon-jump-to-6)
           ("C-c h 7"        . persp-harpoon-jump-to-7)
           ("C-c h 8"        . persp-harpoon-jump-to-8)
           ("C-c h 9"        . persp-harpoon-jump-to-9)
           ;; Select the buffer to jump to with completing-read.
           ;; Will also show the index next to the buffer name
           ("C-c h h"        . persp-harpoon-switch-to))
    :config
    ;; Setup if using perspective.el:
    (persp-harpoon-configure-for-perspective)
    ;; OR
    ;; Setup if using projectile
    (persp-harpoon-configure-for-projectile))
#+end_src

* Usage

** Core commands

The main actions for working with persp-harpoon:

- ~persp-harpoon-add-buffer~ :: Add current buffer's file to harpoon list.
- ~persp-harpoon-remove-buffer~ :: Remove current buffer from harpoon list.
- ~persp-harpoon-clear-buffers~ :: Clear all harpooned buffers for this perspective.
- ~persp-harpoon-jump-to-N~ (N = 1..9) :: Jump to buffer assigned to slot N.
- ~persp-harpoon-switch-to~ :: Interactive completion to switch to any harpooned buffer.
- ~persp-harpoon-show-list~ :: Open buffer for interactive menu/editing of harpoon buffers.
- ~persp-harpoon-switch-other~ :: Jump to next buffer in harpoon list.
- ~persp-harpoon-kill-non-harpoon-buffers~ :: Kill all buffers not in harpoon for current perspective.

** Configuration

To use ~persp-harpoon~, you need to provide functions telling it how to get your "current perspective" and the list of buffers for that perspective.
"perspective" in persp-harpoon can be anything - from persepctive.el, projectile, project, etc.

 See [[#customization][Customization]] for the customizable variables.

Optionally, one could use the =persp-harpoon-configure= function:
- ~persp-harpoon-configure (CURRENT-PERSP-NAME-FUNCTION CURRENT-PERSP-BUFFERS-LIST-FUNCTION)~ Configure persp-harpoon. =CURRENT-PERSP-NAME-FUNCTION= should be a function returning the current perspective name. =CURRENT-PERSP-BUFFERS-LIST-FUNCTION= should be a function returning the list of buffers in the current perspective.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (persp-harpoon-configure
    #'my-persp-name-fn         ;; function returning current perspective name
    #'my-persp-buffers-list-fn ;; function returning buffer list for perspective
  )
#+end_src

=persp-harpoon= comes with the functions =persp-harpoon-configure-for-perspective= and =persp-harpoon-configure-for-projectile=, which configures persp-harpoon to work with ~perspective.el~ and ~projectile~ respectively. In addition to setting the above customizable variables, it also adds additional hooks ( =persp-switch-hook=, and =persp-mode-hook= in perspective.el and =projectile-after-switch-project-hook= and =projectile-mode-hook= in projectile). See the documentation of these functions for more details.

** Customization

Customize group: ~persp-harpoon~

Key customizable variables:
- ~persp-harpoon-current-persp-name-function~ :: A function that returns the name of the current perspective.  This is used to identify which hapoon list should be used. Can also be configured using =persp-harpoon-configure=.
- ~persp-harpoon-current-persp-buffers-list-function~ :: A function that returns the list of buffers or buffer-names in the current perspective. Can also be configured using =persp-harpoon-configure=

* Menu Interface

The interactive menu buffer (~persp-harpoon-show-list~) allows you to:
 - reorder harpoon entries
 - assign indices
 - add/remove buffers from harpoon
 - save changes or abort

Navigation and keybindings are shown in the header line.

[[images/persp-harpoon-menu.gif]]

In the above example, the =.emacs= buffer is being removed from the harpoon list and the other two buffers are reindexed. When applying changes any buffer who's index is "?" or "d" will be removed.
